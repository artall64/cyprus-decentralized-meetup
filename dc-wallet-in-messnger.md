# Hm.. What I should think about?
- How private keys are stored ?
- Is it open source?
- How they generate random numbers?
- Is my connection with bot secure? 
- For example: by default Telegram has very weak security settings.

# Examples
- [Button Wallet](https://buttonwallet.com/) (Store keys in the QR)
- [Chatex](https://botlist.co/bots/chatex) (Store keys on the backend)
- And many more...

# Ok than, what's next
- As a startup you can get a huge user base, that has with the messenger that already installed
- SignUp is the matter of one click to join a channel
- Telegram passport for KYC
- You can customize a bot to accept images, generate voice messages and much more...
